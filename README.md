# DriveTest Booking Bot Web App
DriveTest Bot alerts user whenever a driver's test spot open up. 

It uses Flask and Heroku to deploy the backend, as well as HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap for frontend. This was used to book my very own G licence driver's test! 

For legal reasons, this app has been disabled for any future use, however, the UI is still open to check out at: https://drivetest-bot.herokuapp.com/
